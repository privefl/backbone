\title{Extract backbone using the Stochastic Degree Sequence Model}
\usage{
sdsm(
  B,
  alpha = 0.05,
  signed = FALSE,
  mtc = "none",
  class = "original",
  narrative = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{An unweighted bipartite graph, as: (1) an incidence matrix in the form of a matrix or sparse \code{\link{Matrix}}; (2) an edgelist in the form of a two-column dataframe; (3) an \code{\link{igraph}} object.
Any rows and columns of the associated bipartite matrix that contain only zeros are automatically removed before computations.}

\item{alpha}{real: significance level of hypothesis test(s)}

\item{signed}{boolean: TRUE for a signed backbone, FALSE for a binary backbone (see details)}

\item{mtc}{string: type of Multiple Test Correction to be applied; can be any method allowed by \code{\link{p.adjust}}.}

\item{class}{string: the class of the returned backbone graph, one of c("original", "matrix", "Matrix", "igraph", "edgelist").
If "original", the backbone graph returned is of the same class as \code{B}.}

\item{narrative}{boolean: TRUE if suggested text & citations should be displayed.}

\item{...}{optional arguments}
}
\value{
If \code{alpha} != NULL: Binary or signed backbone graph of class \code{class}.

If \code{alpha} == NULL: An S3 backbone object containing three matrices (the weighted graph, edges' upper-tail p-values,
edges' lower-tail p-values), and a string indicating the null model used to compute p-values, from which a backbone
can subsequently be extracted using \code{\link[=backbone.extract]{backbone.extract()}}. The \code{signed}, \code{mtc}, \code{class}, and \code{narrative} parameters
are ignored.

\description{
\code{sdsm} extracts the backbone of a bipartite projection using the Stochastic Degree Sequence Model.
}
\details{
The \code{sdsm} function compares an edge's observed weight in the projection \code{B*t(B)} to the distribution of weights
expected in a projection obtained from a random bipartite network where both the row vertex degrees and column
vertex degrees are \emph{approximately} fixed at their values in \code{B}. It uses the Bipartite Configuration Model \link{bicm}
to compute probabilities for the Poisson binomial distribution.

When \code{signed = FALSE}, a one-tailed test (is the weight stronger) is performed for each edge with a non-zero weight. It
yields a backbone that perserves edges whose weights are significantly \emph{stronger} than expected in the chosen null
model. When \code{signed = TRUE}, a two-tailed test (is the weight stronger or weaker) is performed for each every pair of nodes.
It yields a backbone that contains positive edges for edges whose weights are significantly \emph{stronger}, and
negative edges for edges whose weights are significantly \emph{weaker}, than expected in the chosen null model.
\emph{NOTE: Before v2.0.0, all significance tests were two-tailed and zero-weight edges were evaluated.}
