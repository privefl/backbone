Description: An implementation of methods for extracting an unweighted unipartite
   graph (i.e. a backbone) from (a) an unweighted unipartite graph, (b) a weighted 
   unipartite graph, (c) the projection of an unweighted bipartite graph, or (d) the
   projection of a weighted bipartite graph. It also provides utility functions to
   generate random binary matrices with (a) given density, (b) given row and column
   marginals, and (c) given row and column marginal distributions.
